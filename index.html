					I love technology and am activly at a colledge completing courses in CIS. My goals for my future is to graduate with a degree in computer science and work in the video game design industry. Technology is my life and I plan to stick with it till the end. On another note, I am constantly working and striving to broaden my knowledge of the tech world and be as activly involved in it as humanly possible. I have also learned many skills in my quest to further my knowledge including have self taught myself HTML, JavaScript and many more languages. My goal is to learn and grow even further in the tech industry and possibly one day form my own company.
